# computing-gravity-of-simple-bodies
Computing gravity and gravity gradient tensor of a cuboid or a sphere.
Aim to present the simple python interface with high computing efficiency as well,which benefits gravity modeling or inversion routine.
The kernel algothm was written in c to obtain highest speed,with optimizing on programming and mathematica,and compiled into dll.
Python interface wrap it into simple functions.

Usage:
put all .py and libgravity_forward.dll together.Import the .py in your own python program(example.py here).
for more information see example.py.
